          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Connor Shen, a data enthusiast transforming complex financial data into actionable insights that drive business decisions. I'm a native of Austin, Texas, with a foundation in Economics from The University of Texas at Austin, where I'm also pursuing a minor in Statistics and Data Science. What started as a fascination with economic theory evolved into a deep-seated passion for data science and quantitative analysis, leading me to pivot my focus toward the intersection of finance and technology.
          <p>
            During my academic journey, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects that showcase the power of data-driven decision making. My work has contributed to significant achievements, including developing trading strategies that outperformed the S&P 500 by over 50%, leading innovative solar energy simulations, and collaborating on NASA's Space Exploration Vehicle project. These experiences across different sectors have sharpened my ability to translate complex data into meaningful insights that drive real-world impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            To me, data science is fundamentally a problem-solving discipline. As a data scientist, I understand that the perfect solution isn't just about statistical accuracy or model complexity â€“ it's about creating insights that drive meaningful decisions. This requires a deep understanding of both technical tools and human behavior, as the most powerful analyses are those that bridge the gap between data and actionable business strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I personally thrive on projects that combine strategic thinking with technical execution. I love diving into challenges from the initial problem definition stage and seeing them through to implementation, whether it's developing trading algorithms, building risk assessment frameworks, or exploring new applications of machine learning. My dream is to become a domain expert who can seamlessly navigate between deep technical analysis and high-level strategic decision-making, helping organizations harness the full potential of their data.
