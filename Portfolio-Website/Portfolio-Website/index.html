    <h2 class="section-title">Economist by Passion, Data Scientist by Principal</h2>
    <p class="about-highlight fade-in">Hello! my name is Connor Shen and welcome to my website!</p>
    <p class="about-description fade-in">
        I like to think of myself as a budding data scientist and economist driven by the desire to solve the world’s problems. Pretty ambitious, I know, but in order to come anywhere close to this, I need the tools to help me solve problems. Because of this, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Economics with a minor in Statistics and Data Science at The University of Texas at Austin where I can combine rigorous analytical thinking with a deep curiosity about how economic systems shape our world.
        <br><br>
        My path into economics and data science began with a simple question: how can we use data to understand and improve the systems that govern our daily lives? This curiosity evolved into a passion for uncovering the intricate relationships between markets, human behavior, and societal outcomes. Through my studies and projects, I've developed expertise in both theoretical frameworks and practical applications, from building algorithmic trading models to conducting socioeconomic research.
        <br><br>
        I've cultivated a strong foundation in statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and economic theory through hands-on experience. My project portfolio includes risk analysis for investment strategies, market prediction models, and research on local issues. These experiences have reinforced my core belief: the most valuable insights emerge when we approach problems objectively and let data guide our understanding.
        <br><br>
        Data science, to me, is the perfect toolkit for modern problem-solving. I've learned that creating effective solutions requires more than technical skills—it demands a deep understanding of economic principles and human behavior. This perspective shapes everything I do, whether I'm developing trading algorithms or analyzing market trends. I focus on delivering solutions that are not only technically robust but also create meaningful impact.
        <br><br>
        I find I thrive the most on projects that blend strategic thinking with technical execution. My goal is to advance in both economics and data science, becoming an expert who can seamlessly move between theoretical analysis and practical implementation. My ultimate goal is to drive significant change in financial markets, economic policy, or corporate strategy through innovative, data-driven approaches that addresses real-world challenges.
