        <h2 class="section-title">Economist by Passion, Data Scientist by Principal</h2>
        <p class="about-highlight fade-in">Hello! my name is Connor Shen and welcome to my website!</p>
        <p class="about-description fade-in">
            I like to think of myself as a budding data scientist and economist driven by the desire to solve the world’s problems. Pretty ambitious, I know, but in order to come anywhere close to this, I need the tools to help me solve problems. Because of this, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Economics with a minor in Statistics and Data Science at The University of Texas at Austin where I can combine rigorous analytical thinking with a deep curiosity about how economic systems shape our world.
            <br><br>
            My path into economics and data science began with a simple question: how can we use data to understand and improve the systems that govern our daily lives? This curiosity evolved into a passion for uncovering the intricate relationships between markets, human behavior, and societal outcomes. Through my studies and projects, I've developed expertise in both theoretical frameworks and practical applications, from building algorithmic trading models to conducting socioeconomic research.
            <br><br>
            I've cultivated a strong foundation in statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and economic theory through hands-on experience. My project portfolio includes risk analysis for investment strategies, market prediction models, and research on local issues. These experiences have reinforced my core belief: the most valuable insights emerge when we approach problems objectively and let data guide our understanding.
            <br><br>
            Data science, to me, is the perfect toolkit for modern problem-solving. I've learned that creating effective solutions requires more than technical skills—it demands a deep understanding of economic principles and human behavior. This perspective shapes everything I do, whether I'm developing trading algorithms or analyzing market trends. I focus on delivering solutions that are not only technically robust but also create meaningful impact.
            <br><br>
            I find I thrive the most on projects that blend strategic thinking with technical execution. My goal is to advance in both economics and data science, becoming an expert who can seamlessly move between theoretical analysis and practical implementation. My ultimate goal is to drive significant change in financial markets, economic policy, or corporate strategy through innovative, data-driven approaches that addresses real-world challenges.

        <h3>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) - ER4 Robotics Intern</h3>
        <p>
          During my time at NASA, I immersed myself in various projects that challenged me to grow both as an engineer and a leader. At the heart of my work was the enhancement of the Space Exploration Vehicle's suspension system, where I optimized PID controllers and developed specialized Python scripts to improve its terrain navigation capabilities. One of my most innovative contributions involved designing and implementing a custom circuit and protective enclosure for radiation testing—a crucial component in ensuring the reliability of electronic systems in space.
          <br><br>
          The experience went far beyond technical development, teaching me invaluable lessons in leadership and collaboration. I guided a team made up of people with vastly different backgrounds through complex challenges, embracing each opportunity to learn and grow while also not being afraid to find a mentor to push us along to our collective success. My hands-on work included the precise assembly of avionics boxes and Power Distribution Units, where attention to detail was paramount for mission-critical systems. Perhaps most rewarding was my collaboration with diverse engineering teams to develop intuitive interfaces for the Lunar Terrain Vehicle, ensuring astronauts could operate efficiently in challenging space environments.
          <br><br>
          This internship was transformative, showing me that in order to be successful, not only my technical capabilities in programming and systems engineering are needed but also the essential soft skills in leadership, adaptability, and empathy are just as important. Contributing to humanity's space exploration efforts while working alongside dedicated professionals has reinforced my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible through technology and collaboration.

        <h3>Longhorn Racing Solar - Power Generation Member</h3>
        <p>
          Building a car is tough enough but making it solar powered is a whole different beast. And that’s exactly why I love being in this student organization. Working with people that constantly challenge and push the boundaries of what’s technically possible to create the most competitive vehicle is a constant reminder that there is always something to learn, to improve on, and to ultimately grow as people.
          <br><br>
          During my time with the Longhorn Racing Solar Vehicle Team, I focused on developing programming solutions for optimizing the vehicle's solar power systems. One of my key contributions was designing and implementing data-driven simulations to maximize solar panel output that enhanced sustained and efficient power generation. Additionally, I created a database for solar cell simulation data, leveraging Python for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for querying and database management. This ensured reliable data storage and efficient retrieval, supporting the team's performance goals. All of our projects and code are open-source software, making them accessible to everyone, which is core to our philosophy here at LHR Solar.
